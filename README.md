# SBC Giveaway

(SBC = "single board computer", aka, a usually arm/riscv64 small computer like a raspberry pi)

**Summary**:

* I own too many of these things, I never seem to get past a 
  tinkering phase. While I've learned a fair bit, I'm not sure it's useful
  unless I'm going to go work in embedded applications, etc.
* Much of what I have gained is trauma and an appreciation for those
  who try to drive mainline+standardization in the SBC world
* I'm doing the digital nomad thing, so I'm either remote-operating a human-being to
  manipulate boards & wires, or carrying excess weight as I travel
* I have a lot of software-only Nix-adjacent projects that I'm excited to sink
  serious effort and energy into

**Giveaway**:

* I can ship them to you if you can help cover S+H.
* I can haul them over to Darmstadt and give them to folks at NixCon2023.

Ideally, by time I leave for Europe, all boards will be shipped or promised
to folks that I will then see in Darmstadt.

**Criteria**

* You are a Nixer, or want to be!

* (bonus) you want to contribute, or maintain support for the SBC, in:
  * [mobile-nixos](https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos)
  * [tow-boot](https://github.com/tow-boot/Tow-Boot)
  * [nixos-hardware](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-hardware)


**Notes**

* **If you're interested, just comment on the open issues**

* I have no qualms about giving anyone multiple boards, but be careful what you wish for :)
* Thus, feel free to comment on multiple issues. That might work out nicely in case multiple
  people are interested in a board and some would be happy with an alternative.
